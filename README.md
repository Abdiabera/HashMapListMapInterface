This repository appears to focus on implementations or interfaces related to hash maps and list mapsâ€”data structures commonly used for
efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. The project likely provides code for creating, manipulating, and interacting with these map 
structures, which are fundamental in many programming tasks. By abstracting or implementing these interfaces, the repository may allow developers 
to use standardized methods for map operations, improve code reusability,and facilitate learning about these data structures.
